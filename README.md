I'm good with node and AWS platforms but I'm not too expert in ReactJS yet .All the custom http apis work with the postman platform.In front end I could'nt add all the apis but I added the most required ones. I did my best in this project development and if everything favors in right way I'm positive that I'll do my best at the company and thank you for this opportunity .
